# SwapIt – Card Deal Web Application

SwapIt is a frontend web application that demonstrates a card-based interaction system for exchanging or dealing items.  
The project focuses on clean UI design, component-based architecture, and modern frontend development practices.

This application was built as part of my academic work to understand how real-world web applications are structured and developed using modern tools.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to design and implement a responsive, user-friendly card interface that can be used for item exchange or deal-based workflows.  
The emphasis is on frontend logic, UI behavior, and maintainable code structure rather than backend complexity.
